# Setting Up This Repository as a GitHub Template

This guide explains how to enable the "Use this template" feature on GitHub.

## Steps to Enable Template Feature

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**

2. **Click on "Settings"** (top menu bar)

3. **Scroll down to "Template repository"** section

4. **Check the box** that says "Template repository"

5. **Click "Save"**

That's it! Now users can:
- Click the green "Use this template" button on your repository
- Create a new repository from your template
- Start building their website immediately

## What Users Will See

When someone clicks "Use this template", they'll:
1. Get a new repository with all your code
2. Have a clean git history (no connection to your template)
3. Be able to customize everything for their own project

## Best Practices

- Keep the template clean and well-documented
- Update README.md with clear instructions
- Use `siteConfig.ts` for easy customization
- Keep placeholder content that's easy to replace
